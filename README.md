## Introduction

This project represents a bulletin board for selling cars. It consists of two parts: a backend built with Nest.js and a frontend built with Next.js.

## Backend (Nest.js)

The backend provides an API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting car sale listings. It also manages the database for storing car listings.

### Running the Backend

To run the backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
 
   ```cd autotop-backend```
   
Install dependencies:

```npm install```

Start the server:

```npm run start```
The backend will run on port 3210 by default.

Frontend (Next.js)
The frontend provides a user interface for viewing and creating car sale listings. It interacts with the backend through an API.

Running the Frontend
To run the frontend, follow these steps:

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```cd autotop-frontend```
Install dependencies:

```npm install```
Start the application:

```npm run dev```
The frontend will run on port 3000 by default.

Usage
After starting the backend and frontend, you can open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the car sales bulletin board.
